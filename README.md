# Index-Tracking  
In this project, we mainly research on the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Deep Neural Network approaches in index tracking.
There are two main steps for index tracking: stock selection and weight allocation. For the stock selection part, we use PCA and autoencoder,
and for the weight allocation part we use optimization and deep neural networks. Our goal is to
use a relatively small number of stocks to minimize tracking error.
